Homework 4 - CrystalsCollector Game

## Crystal Collector

### How the Game Works:

1. Four crystal buttons are displayed on the page.

2. You'll be shown a random number at the start of the game.
	- **Note:** Your goal is to total this number.

3. When you click on a crystal, it'll add a specific amount of points to your total score.
	- **Note:** You can't see amounts, so once you click a button remember how much it is!

4. You win once your button points match the starting number *exactly*.

### Things to Keep In Mind:
- You lose if your button points exceed your starting number.
- When a round ends (either winning or losing), the game will reset. A new goal and crystal point value will generate, and your score will be tracked in the "Wins/Losses" table.
- **DON'T REFRESH THE PAGE.** You'll lose your score.
